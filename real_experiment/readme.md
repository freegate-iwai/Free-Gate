In this folder there is the code for the real-hardware experiment to be submitted to the Robotarium platform.

One of the experiments simulated for the paper *Free-Gate: Planning, Control And Policy Composition Via Free Energy Gating* is run.
Specifically, the unicycle robot is driven from the initial position $x_0=[1.2, 0.6]^{\top}$ to the goal position $x_d=[-1.3, 0]^{\top}$ while avoiding the obstacles by using the Free-Gate algorithm.

The resulting video of the real-hardware experiment is shown here:
